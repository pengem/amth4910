 Code from a senior thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor’s Degree in the Yale Applied Mathematics Program 

mainloop.m is where everything is controlled! this allows for several independent simulations. 

maincode.m is where the bulk of the work happens. this is where all of the parameters are located.

twodvisualization.m and threedvisualization.m produces .gif files of the last simulated result.

geometryfigure.m is just to plot a schematic for the battery layer. this was used in the thesis write up. 

hazardplot.m is another file just to plot the hazard function, used in the thesis write up.
